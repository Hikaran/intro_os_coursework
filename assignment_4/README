# Purpose

The purpose of the program is to implement a voting counter application that
works across a distribted network.

# Compiling

Simply run `make`.

# Running

To run server

./server dagfile port

To run client

./client reqfile hostip port

# What it does

The program works by having a server that runs and keeps keeps track of,
modifies, etc. an in-memory DAG.

The client connects to it and instructs the server what operations to perform
on the DAG.

See the write up for in-depth descriptions of the possible actions the server
can accept and how the messages are passed between the server and client.
