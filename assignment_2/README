# Purpose

The purpose of this program is to create a suite of utilities that can be used
for counting votes. The votes can be divided up into different regions and
the votes will be counted up in parallel by different processes.

# Compilation

To compile the program, make sure that you are in this directory and simply run
`make`.  This will produce 3 binary executables: `Vote_Counter`,
`Leaf_Counter`, and `Aggregate_Votes`.

# Usage

To run any of the programs simply give them a path to the root directory you
would like to run them in

`Vote_Counter some/path`

`Aggregate_Votes some/other/path`

`Leaf_Counter yet/another/path`

Note that when you call, you **MUST NOT** have a trailing slash, the following
**WILL** cause an error!

`Vote_Counter some/path/`

# Overview/Methodology

The key to how the program operates lies in `votes.c` where a linked list
structure for the vote results and helper functions are defined. Each node
in the linked list contains a candidate string and a number of votes. There
are helper functions to parse an input string (E.g. "A:4,B:6") and add the
votes to the corresponding nodes or create new nodes if they are not present
in the list. There are also helper functions to convert a linked list to
a string representation as well as others.

`Vote_Counter` simply runs `Aggregate_Votes` on the given path, parses the
final result string and appends the winner to the output file.

`Aggregate_Votes` determines if it is being run on a leaf node or not, if it
is then it execs `Leaf_Counter`. Otherwise it cycles through each subdir
and recursively execs `Aggregate_Votes` on each subdir. After which it reads
in all of the result files and adds in each result string to a single linked
list structure. The final summed linked list is output into a file.

`Leaf_Counter` looks for a file called votes.txt in the directory it is given
and counts the number of votes for each candidate found within. Empty lines
will be skipped as if the associated voter abstained from voting. By extension,
an empty file is treated as a region where all citizens chose to abstain.
Votes are tallied using a linked list of vote counters containing one entry per
candidate. This linked list is then used to generate a one-line output file
giving the total number of votes recorded for each candidate.

The extra credit assignment resolved in Vote_Counter by crawling iteratively
through each directory, starting from the root. For every subdirectory found,
a process is forked to check that directory as well. For every symbolic link
found, a process is forked to check if the link forms a cycle. A message is
appended to the main results file for each cycle discovered. A token is used
to keep track of which process was the original; all others exit upon reaching
the end of the function.
